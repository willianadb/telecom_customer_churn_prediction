# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## üìÑ Project Description
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. Accurately identifying customers likely to cancel services allows the company to implement proactive strategies to retain customers and improve satisfaction.

The work was developed in two versions: Portuguese and English, aiming to reach an international audience. The project includes an exploratory data analysis, the application of various predictive models, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance.

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing raw and processed data.
  - `raw/`: Original data files.
  - `processed/`: Data after preprocessing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks containing analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
  - `portuguese/`: Notebook version in Portuguese.
  - `english/`: Notebook version in English.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and model evaluation.
  - `portuguese/`
  - `english/`
- `models/`: Trained models saved for future use.
  - `portuguese/`
  - `english/`
- `results/`: Results of the analyses, graphs, and other outputs generated by the notebooks.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you are here).

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to better understand the data and identify patterns that may influence customer churn. Some of the analyses included:
- Distribution of categorical and numerical variables.
- Correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between variables.
- Study of the distribution of customers who canceled and retained the service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing
The `preprocess_data.py` script performs the following data preparation steps:
- Converts column names to `snake_case` format.
- Merges multiple data files (`contract.csv`, `personal.csv`, `internet.csv`, `phone.csv`).
- Handles missing values.
- Encodes categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
- Normalizes numerical variables.
- Creates the target variable and new relevant features.

## üß† Predictive Modeling
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

### üõ†Ô∏è Hyperparameter Tuning
The most promising models (XGBoost, LightGBM) were tuned using `RandomizedSearchCV` and `GridSearchCV`. The AUC-ROC metric was used as the main criterion for selecting the best model.

## üìà Evaluation and Results
The best model selected was **XGBoost**, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.9113. Threshold adjustments were made to optimize the model and improve the identification of customers likely to cancel the service. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score were analyzed for each model, highlighting the effectiveness of the final model.

## üöÄ Next Steps and Final Considerations
- **Production Implementation:** The model is ready to be deployed in production to predict churn in real-time.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of the model is suggested to evaluate its performance with new data.
- **Future Adjustments:** Additional hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering can be performed to further improve the model's performance.
